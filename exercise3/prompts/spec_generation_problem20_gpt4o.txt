Problem description: From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).

Method signature: def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method.

Let 'res' denote the expected return value of find_closest_elements().

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Do NOT call find_closest_elements() in your assertions (no self-reference)
- Do NOT use methods with side effects such as:
  - print, read, write, input operations
  - random number generation (random.random(), random.choice(), etc.)
  - timing functions (time.time(), datetime.now(), etc.)
  - data structure mutations (list.append(), dict.update(), set.add(), etc.)
- Express the relationship between inputs and 'res' using pure arithmetic, string operations, and boolean logic only

Generate approximately 5 formal specifications as Python assert statements.

Example format:
```python
# Specification 1: [Brief description of property]
assert [condition about inputs and res]

# Specification 2: [Brief description of property]
assert [condition about inputs and res]
```
