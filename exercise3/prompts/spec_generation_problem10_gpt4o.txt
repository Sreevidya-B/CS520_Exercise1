Problem description: Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. Algorithm idea is simple: - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome. - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

Method signature: def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method.

Let 'res' denote the expected return value of make_palindrome().

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Do NOT call make_palindrome() in your assertions (no self-reference)
- Do NOT use methods with side effects such as:
  - print, read, write, input operations
  - random number generation (random.random(), random.choice(), etc.)
  - timing functions (time.time(), datetime.now(), etc.)
  - data structure mutations (list.append(), dict.update(), set.add(), etc.)
- Express the relationship between inputs and 'res' using pure arithmetic, string operations, and boolean logic only

Generate approximately 5 formal specifications as Python assert statements.

Example format:
```python
# Specification 1: [Brief description of property]
assert [condition about inputs and res]

# Specification 2: [Brief description of property]
assert [condition about inputs and res]
```
